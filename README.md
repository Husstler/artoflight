# Art of Light

> *"For in the light, all shadows bend to serve."*

A satirical artistic website presenting **gaslighting** as a mystical doctrine through scripture-like verses. The site features elegant dark aesthetics, flame particle effects, and typewriter-revealed "sacred teachings."

## 🔥 Features

- **Sacred Verses**: 40+ poetic, rhyming teachings (2-4 lines each) that humorously glorify the philosophy of reality manipulation
- **Scripture Citations**: Each verse includes a proper citation (e.g., "ArtOfLight 2:14")
- **Flame Animations**: Letters appear with a burning glow effect that cools to parchment color
- **Ember Particles**: Floating fire particles create an atmospheric background
- **Elegant Typography**: Cinzel Decorative for titles, Marck Script for handwritten verses
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile

## 🎭 The Doctrine

The verses preach the "sacred art" of:
- Rewriting memories and reality
- Forgetting what others said while remembering you were right
- Planting ideas and claiming ownership
- The art of selective recollection
- Speaking with calm certainty to sow doubt
